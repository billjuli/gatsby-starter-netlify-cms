Starting in Wanaka town center, head out of town on SH6 and you’ll be on your way to the charming village of Cromwell with world-class vineyards and cellar door experiences along the way.  </p>\n<p>Heading out of Wanaka  you’ll pass iconic attractions such as Mount Iron and Puzzling world.  Turn right onto Riverbank Rd, cross Ballantyne Rd, and you will come to Aitken’s Folly Vineyard where the cellar door is open seasonally from 11am - 5pm (ish, if the flag's flying, they’re still open!), 7 days a week for wine tasting and sales.  Aitken’s Folly is a family run boutique winery producing award winning Pinot Noir and Chardonnay and well worth a visit. </p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 550px;\"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/ef624231c43928869c365d259b338b4f/c603d/aitkens-fo-lly-entrance.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 75.0909090909091%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,/9j/2wBDABALDA4MChAODQ4SERATGCgaGBYWGDEjJR0oOjM9PDkzODdASFxOQERXRTc4UG1RV19iZ2hnPk1xeXBkeFxlZ2P/2wBDARESEhgVGC8aGi9jQjhCY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2NjY2P/wgARCAAPABQDASIAAhEBAxEB/8QAFwAAAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMEAf/EABYBAQEBAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMBAv/aAAwDAQACEAMQAAABRUrTlBKJn//EABkQAAMBAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABAhESMv/aAAgBAQABBQKvcTyZI6VHTNZ//8QAFxEBAAMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABITQf/aAAgBAwEBPwGOK3//xAAYEQADAQEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARECE//aAAgBAgEBPwFbjp3Z/8QAGRABAQADAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAQACEDEy/9oACAEBAAY/AlkyQvRvt//EABoQAQACAwEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEAESExUeH/2gAIAQEAAT8hyDdPZUCHIruPvy+5yNADqWsf/9oADAMBAAIAAwAAABCo/wD/xAAWEQEBAQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABABH/2gAIAQMBAT8QQkzf/8QAFxEBAAMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAEhYf/aAAgBAgEBPxCkQwf/xAAdEAEAAgICAwAAAAAAAAAAAAABABEhMUFhkcHR/9oACAEBAAE/EHdAW/apgnMhSrZBtPhxKtjxQriopvQA1oxFx5dHyf/Z'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"Aitken&#39;s Folly\"\n        title=\"Aitken&#39;s Folly\"\n        src=\"/static/ef624231c43928869c365d259b338b4f/c603d/aitkens-fo-lly-entrance.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/ef624231c43928869c365d259b338b4f/ba1ca/aitkens-fo-lly-entrance.jpg 512w,\n/static/ef624231c43928869c365d259b338b4f/c603d/aitkens-fo-lly-entrance.jpg 550w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p><em>The entrance to Aitken's Folly.</em></p>\n<p>Head back to SH6 via Riverbank Rd. The scenery is outstanding, rolling hills and lofty mountains. Take it slow on corners though as the roads are a bit windy, making for an even more spectacular drive, twisting and turning between mountain ranges. Passing the Lavender Farm on Morris Rd adds to the scenic experience. <br>\n<br>\nAnother major attraction on the way is the Wanaka Airport, home to Warbirds of Wanaka. The National Transport Museum has many attractions on offer with experiences such as  a fine brewery, a toy/gift shop, a 50’s style diner as well as a museum. If you desire a flying lesson, the transport museum has simulators provided as well as alpine helicopter tours. You’ll get a real taste for New Zealand on your way from Wanaka to Cromwell, passing traditional Kiwi farms with Creifel range to the right. If you long for a skydive, SkyDive Wanaka will tickle your fancy. Crossfire, once known as Have a Shot, is another experience to have on your scenic journey. A highlight, however, is passing through Luggate, a sweet wee village, and popping into the town's iconic pub. If you wish to update your history knowledge or simply win some gold make sure to stop off at Roxburgh Gold panning where you’ll be taught the History of Dunstan’s gold rush as well as given the opportunity to pan for gold. If nature calls or you simply desire an excuse to stretch your legs, there are public toilets at Luggate Hall kept to a good standard. </p>\n<p><span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n      style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 2048px;\"\n    >\n      <a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/308909cfe46f2bd0415cf7c5e6035499/d280c/20200104_110024.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n    style=\"padding-bottom: 56.25%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n  ></span>\n  <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        alt=\"The Luggate Hotel\"\n        title=\"The Luggate Hotel\"\n        src=\"/static/308909cfe46f2bd0415cf7c5e6035499/07827/20200104_110024.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/308909cfe46f2bd0415cf7c5e6035499/ba1ca/20200104_110024.jpg 512w,\n/static/308909cfe46f2bd0415cf7c5e6035499/e937d/20200104_110024.jpg 1024w,\n/static/308909cfe46f2bd0415cf7c5e6035499/07827/20200104_110024.jpg 2048w,\n/static/308909cfe46f2bd0415cf7c5e6035499/f68ae/20200104_110024.jpg 3072w,\n/static/308909cfe46f2bd0415cf7c5e6035499/d280c/20200104_110024.jpg 3264w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;\"\n        loading=\"lazy\"\n      />\n  </a>\n    </span></p>\n<p><em>The Luggate Hotel.</em></p>\n<p>Heading further on your journey, around Queensbury, the road will follow the famous Clutha River. In this same pocket of bliss is the Nanny Goat Vineyard (signposted from the highway) providing unique cellar door experiences to kick off your Central Otago Vineyard tour.
